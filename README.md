# TheDTree

This is a mini-project to initiate my self into programming. The name does not have any hidden meaning and can be changed anytime.
I will start programming from scratch, in other words "Hello World", until the recombination of 2 different DNAs. So, as predicted it is about Bio-Informatics.

Take it easy, we all started crawling.
